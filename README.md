*In this task, I built a simple chatbot using Python and the NLTK library. The chatbot understands basic messages like "hi", "bye", and "thank you", and gives appropriate replies. I used NLTKâ€™s lemmatizer to process the text and match user inputs with common keywords. The chatbot runs in the terminal, and responds to the user based on the words they type. This version is easy to run and shows how basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) works.*
